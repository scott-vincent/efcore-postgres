# efcore-postgres

This is an example of how to write a REST API in ASP.NET Core 2.2 using the Entity Framework (EF Core).

It performs basic CRUD operations on a Postgres database and includes generated Swagger documentation.
It also includes a Dockerfile and docker-compose file for easy hosting in Docker (where I also hosted Postgres and PgAdmin).
